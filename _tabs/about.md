<p>
My name is Amin Ziagham, I graduated with a master's degree in computer science and am currently working in the GE Healthcare in Norway. I'm a detail-oriented and self-driven .NET developer with over 10 years of professional experience in software development. Experience in various software patterns, architectures, and methodologies such as: Unit of work and repository pattern, N-tier architecture, Onion architecture, Event-driven architecture, CQS and CQRS architectural pattern, Plugin-based architecture, Restful-based architecture, etc. I am eager to learn new things and adapt myself to new technologies, concepts, and theories of computer and software engineering.
<br /><br />
In the meantime, I always tried to help others in the way of learning programming and software development. My motto has always been <b>"Expressing advanced topics and concepts in coding and software engineering with eloquent and simple words"</b>. In fact, during the first several years of learning and working in the computer industry, I didn't have enough time to write down and document what I was learning. But now is the right time, and from now on I will try to share the new things that I learn in addition to the old ones.
